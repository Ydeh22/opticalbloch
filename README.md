# OpticalBloch

## What is this?

OpticalBloch is a Python tool for solving the optical Bloch equations for light interacting with an ensemble of atoms.

It requires the [QuTiP][qutip] library for simulating the dynamics of open
quantum systems, as well NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib. So install those packages first.
